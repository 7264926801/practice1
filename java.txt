every variable has some type 

each and every  data type is cleared defined 

every assignment should be by compiler for type compatiablity 
becoze if above reason we can conclude is strong ly type programing language.

Q.java is object oriented or not ?

 ----> NOT,
       
       1)java is a not concider pure object oriented lsngusge because several oops feature are not satisfied by java (operator overloading , multiple inheritance , etc)

       2) more over dpending on premitive data type which are non object.


  ** PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE **
 
             1) Numeric data type                                                   2) Non-Numeric data type

                                                                                           1) char
                  1) intgral data type                                                     2) String

                     1 -->byte
                     2 -->short
                     3 -->int 
                     4 -->long


                  2) Floating-point data type 

                     1 --> Float
                     2 --> double 

 1) 1 byte = 1 (bit)
